This is GITHUB repo for British Airways Review Analysis

It is project given by @Forage of the @British Airways (BA)

Here is the step by step guide what I did

- 01. Data Collection : Collected the Data from the website called Skytrax which had around 4000 reviews about the BA.
                       Then after downloading the all the required data converted it into a CSV file called 
                       *"british_airways_reviews_extended.csv"*
                      
                      
- 02. Data Cleaning   : Imported all the essential Libraries
                        Read the Dataset
                        Checking the Null Values
                        Checking all the Columns and Datatypes
                        Renamking the Column from date to review_date
                        Converting all the Column names to lower
                        Dropping the Unnecessary Columns
                        Remove "âœ… Trip Verified" and "Not Verified" from reviews
                        Function to clean ordinal suffixes like '1st', '2nd', '3rd', '4th'
